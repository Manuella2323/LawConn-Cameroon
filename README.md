# LawConn-Cameroon
LawConn Cameroon is a proposed cloud-based Platform designed to improve legal awareness among Cameroonian citizens and simplify access to professional legal assistance. The project addresses the lack of accessible and up-to-date legal information by offering an online platform that centralizes national laws, citizensâ€™ rights, and lawyer contacts.
